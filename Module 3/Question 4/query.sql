/*
Write a SELECT statement that returns these column names and data from the Products table:
product_name	The product_name column
list_price	The list_price column
discount_percent	The discount_percent column
discount_amount	A column that’s calculated from the previous two columns
discount_price	A column that’s calculated from the previous three columns
Round the discount_amount and discount_price columns to 2 decimal places.
Sort the result set by the discount_price column in descending sequence.
Use the LIMIT clause so the result set contains only the first 5 rows.
