/*
Write a script that creates a stored procedure named test. This stored procedure should create a cursor for a result set that consists of the product_name and list_price columns for each product with a list price that’s greater than $700. The rows in this result set should be sorted in descending sequence by list price. The stored procedure should accept an OUT  parameter where a message is passed out of the procedure.  Then, the procedure should set the out parameter to a string variable that includes the product_name and list price for each product so it looks something like this:
*Gibson SG*,*2517.00*|*Gibson Les Paul*,*1199.00*|
Here, each value is enclosed in asterisk(*), each column is separated by a     comma (,) and each row is separated by a pipe character (|).
